# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify key patterns and factors influencing booking cancellations.
## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/nishusapkota/hotel-booking-cancellation-analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20Booking%20Cancellation.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions
- What is the overall booking and cancellation count?
- How do cancellations vary by guest type?
- Do cancellations differ by hotel type (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)?
- Does room assignment (desired vs undesired) affect cancellations?
- Are there seasonal trends in cancellations?
- How do trends differ across years?
- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/nishusapkota/hotel-booking-cancellation-analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20Booking%20Cancellation.pdf">View Dashboard</a>
## Process
- Import and understand the dataset, load the hotel booking dataset into excel.
- Data cleaning , make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Data preprocessing and Transformation, create new columns: "room_status" and "guest_type" using IF statement for deeper analysis.
- Pivot table creation according to the questions asked.
- merge all pivot table into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insights
- Around 37% of total bookings were cancelled, highlighting a high cancellation rate.
- Couples had the highest number of bookings and cancellations.
- Family guests showed the lowest cancellation rate, indicating more reliable bookings.
- City Hotels see more cancellations than Resort Hotels.
- August and September showed peak cancellations, pointing to seasonal patterns.
- Year-wise filtering enabled deeper insights into trends over 2015â€“2017.
## Final Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into hotel booking cancellations using Excel-based data analysis and interactive dashboards. By transforming raw data through calculated columns and pivot tables, we identified key trends such as higher cancellation rates among couples and city hotels, the impact of room assignment on booking outcomes, and strong seasonal patterns in cancellation behavior. The findings highlight the importance of guest satisfaction and operational accuracy in minimizing cancellations. Overall, this analysis can help hotel managers make more informed decisions to improve booking reliability and enhance customer experience.
